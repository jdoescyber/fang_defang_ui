# fang_defang_ui

 A quick and dirty Tkinter UI for fanging and defanging text.

To be entirely clear, this project is made possible by the folks that maintain [the ioc_fanger project](https://github.com/ioc-fang/ioc-fanger).
As of 2021-10-30, the listed contributors are:

* [fhightower (Floyd Hightower)](https://github.com/fhightower)
* [Wesinator (Wes)](https://github.com/wesinator)
* [ilyaglow (Ilya)](https://github.com/ilyaglow)
* [panzertime (RT Hatfield)](https://github.com/panzertime)

Without their contributions to `ioc_fanger`, this project would have been much harder or not even written. Please consider supporting them.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed. I developed with Python 3.10, but I imagine it will run on other Python 3.x versions.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/jdoescyber/fang_defang_ui` or download the repo as a zip.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or manually `pip install ioc_fanger`.
  * May need to use `pip3`
4. Launch the GUI: `python fang_defang.py` or `python3 fang_defang.py`.

## Future Changes

In the future, I may work on bundling the entire project as an executable, at least for Windows.

## Feedback

This is my first time using Tkinter and honestly I'm sure my setup is a mess. Any and all feedback is welcome in the form of a GitHub issue!
